\section{Summary}
Communicating science is just as important as doing science. Without being able
to explain your motivation and results, finding support (either funding or
otherwise) will be difficult. Aside from getting direct support, explaining and
exploring the social consequences of science and technology is vital. Science
and technology can change the world, but history shows that those changes donâ€™t
come without tradeoffs. Thinking hard about these areas requires engaging with a
variety of different people on complex subjects. \\

Research-wise, my PhD has been focused on developing and applying computational
methods to study materials used in LEDs. LED bulbs are still very expensive
compared to bulbs like incandescents and compact-fluorescents. I am trying to
reduce that cost by modeling LED materials on supercomputers. My methods can
predict properties of materials long before an experimentalists has to go
through the expensive and time consuming process of making the material in the
lab. That time and money can be saved by my calculations, leading to faster
discovery of materials that have desirable properties. With my calculations, I
hope to find new materials that can be realized in the lab that will lead to
more efficient and cheaper LEDs.
