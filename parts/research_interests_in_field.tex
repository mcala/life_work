\subsubsection{Interests} 
I develop and apply computational methods for studying structural, electronic,
optical, and recombination processes in materials. Using these methods with
high-performance computing resources allows me to understand fundamental
properties of in-use materials, and to design materials with more desireable 
properties. I am also interested in effectively communicating research to both
technical and lay audiences in a variety of media. Research poorly communicated
cannot recieve financial or public support.
